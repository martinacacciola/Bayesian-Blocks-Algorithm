# Project 04 - Bayesian Blocks Algorithm
_Diego Bonato, Martina Cacciola_ - Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis (A.A. 2022/23)

The Bayesian Blocks algorithm offers a way to improve the binning process of histograms by finding the optimal segmentation of the data in the observation interval. The advantage is its ability to create histograms that faithfully capture the underlying distribution of the data, by separating statistically significant features from random observational fluctuactions. In this project, we have implemented the Bayesian Blocks algorithm in R and assessed its effectiveness by testing it on different datasets to see how well it performs.
